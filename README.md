Will It Get Better?
This thesis takes a predictive analysis approach utilizing a multilayered neural network with multivalued neurons to predict values on datasets that measure or indicate social progress by measuring it in terms of changes in many important areas, which are definitive for understanding of how societies and societal life in different countries and worldwide develop and perceived. The datasets collected assess:


Average Wage
Disposable Income
GDP
Gender Equity
Global Education
Hate Crimes (U.S. Only)
Housing Cost Price Index
Inflation
Premature Mortality
Refugees and Asylum Seekers
Surface Temperature
Unemployment (U.S. Only)
Violent Crime (U.S Only)
Women in Parliament
World Happiness


From this analysis there were notable findings in many of the datasets, but those include:
A statistically significant difference in the percentage change of average wage, globally, from the years of 1993-2008 and then 2009-2024.  There was a -60% decrease in wage growth.  While there is an overall increase over time, the rate at which wages are growing is a sharp decrease from the increases enjoyed during the years of 1993-2008.
When assessing premature mortality, all countries with the lowest averages of premature mortality or showed the greatest percentage decrease in premature mortality had a significant universal healthcare option.  Some countries in those lists also had a significant private healthcare industry, but all countries were inclusive of a public option for universal healthcare.
The rate at which the surface temperature is increasing has decreased in recent years. So, while the overall trend is increasing, the worldwide community has reduced the rate at which it is increasing.
Housing is generally becoming more affordable or, is predicted to trend in that direction.  While it is not at previous levels of affordability enjoyed largely in the 1980s, the rate at which the housing cost price index is increasing has sharply dropped from the rate at which is was increasing from 1993-2008,
The world is generally becoming happier.  This happiness index includes generosity, social inclusion, GDP, and life expectancy. The rate at which happiness is increasing is predicted to double since the first five years of assessment. Additionally, the spread of happiness indices has diminished, meaning there is generally less disparity in happiness worldwide.
